# General
- i'd like everything? to be editable. 
example: if i click on e-mail in mail app, i'd like to edit it and "send" appears and it sends the new mail out.
- what about #autosave based on the versioned fs or at least some git directories?
- contacts, chat and mail are actually one app i think. it's just user/person-id (such as e-mail address) with different operations available to it
- what about reusing the existing app window to inject different content into it? 
example: i fire up notes, write notes, then decide it's actually good enough to send it as e-mail, thus i click either "convert to e-mail" or fire up the mail app. what happens in the background is that the notes app window is reused and the mail app window components are injected in and the text editor of the note app is composited into the mail app.
- let's get smalltalk-y - if error happens, take me to the app source that should be directly editable too
- maybe an "inspect" button on app title bar if something goes wrong?

# Mail app
- forward/reply/unsubscribe would be nice

# Notes app
- i'd like to convert my notes into e-mail

# Browser app
- i'd like to edit and publish any page that i own online

# Alarms app
- it'd nice to edit the alarms
- it'd be nice to define actions on alarms. let's say i have a meeting at 3pm, the alarm would ring and popped up calendar? with meeting details (invitees, location etc.), or it'd fire up my browser on a certain webpage, or a chat window with particular person, or launch whatever query/workflow etc.

# Command bar app
- if a command doesn't exist/is not defined, let's fire up query/workflow/automation tool and let the user define what it should do, preferably by compositing existing commands to produce desired result(s)?

# Workflow app
- let's make query/workflow/automation tool
# Music player app
- #contacts, #chat and #mail are actually one app i think. it's just user/person-id (such as e-mail address) with different operations available to it
- web radios?
- scrobbler?
example: i play some music offline and it gets synced with online music service, including metadata (or the service figures out what it is)

# AV recorder app
- let's record audio and video
